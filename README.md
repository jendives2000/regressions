# Project Description: 
## Practice Exercise #2:  
You are working as a data scientist for a **retail company**. The management wants to: 
*   understand the relationship between:
    - the number of online customer reviews for a product
    - and the monthly sales figures for that product.

**They believe that more reviews should correlate with higher sales** but want to quantify this  
relationship to guide marketing strategies.  

### Objectives  
1.   Determine the stength of the relationship between:  
    - the number of customer reviews (independent variable 𝑋)  
    - and monthly sales (dependent variable 𝑌).
     
2.   Present your conclusions and recommendations

### Dataset:  
The dataset was **randomly created using pandas**, this ensures we do **not bring bias** into the set.  
It has 120 rows.  

## Practice Exercise #1:  
You are a data scientist working for an e-commerce company.  
The marketing team wants to:  
*   understand the relationship between:
    - the amount of money spent on online advertising
    - and the revenue generated from those ads

**They believe that more spendings on ad should correlate with higher revenues** but want to quantify this  
relationship to guide marketing strategies.  

### Objectives  
1.   Determine the stength of the relationship between:  
    - the amount of money spent on online advertising (independent variable 𝑋)  
    - and the revenue generated from those ads (dependent variable 𝑌).
     
2.   Present your conclusions and recommendations

### Dataset:  
The dataset was uploaded from an external source as part of a specialized course.
It has 10 rows.  

# Methodology:
For relationship strength evaluation between 2 variables, the **Pearson correlation coefficient** is the way to go.  
For practice and memorization purposes, I added the **mathematical formula** whenever it is needed using the **LaTex** language.  
For calculations I used the **numpy library**.

For visualizations, I used **matplotlib and scipy** to add the function itself.

My name is Jean-Yves TRAN, I bring 9 years of promotional video creation and project management into Data. My goal is to  
first become an ML Engineer and leverage that experience to mature into a Data Scientist.
